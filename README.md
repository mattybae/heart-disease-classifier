# breast-cancer-classifier
Breast cancer prediction using classification models on tabular clinical data from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that trains and evaluates
Logistic Regression & Random Forest models to predict heart disease from clinical
features.

Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were evaluated using Accuracy and ROC-AUC, and importance of features.

## Conclusion 

This dataset shows that tumour size (radius in mm) is positively correlated with whether a cancer is malignant or benign. The above models were also shown to be good predictors for breast cancer.
