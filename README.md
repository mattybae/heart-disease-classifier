# heart-disease-classifier
Heart disease prediction using classification models on tabular clinical data from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that trains and evaluates
several classification models to predict heart disease from clinical
features (tabular dataset).

Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were evaluated using Accuracy and ROC-AUC, and importance of features.
